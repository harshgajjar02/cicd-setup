In this setup we will just run everything on containers for practing cicd
Also its not recommended to run it on single machine
I am using t2.medium till now if pipeline fails i will split the services in differnt instances

for jenkins after docker compose up see the logs and you will get intial password
for nexus3 run command docker exec -it <<containerId>> cat /nexus_data/admin.password

security group settings
jenkins = ssh from my ip , all-traffic from my ip
nexus = ssh from my ip , all-traffic from my ip , all traffic from jenkin-security group 
sonar = ssh from my ip , all-traffic from my ip, all traffic from jenkin-security group

sonaqube setup
